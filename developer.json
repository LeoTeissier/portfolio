Here are some of my key experiences:<br><br>- InovShop Digital: During a 10-week internship at InovShop Digital, a web development company, I developed an online media library using JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. My primary responsibilities included designing and implementing features for managing and sharing multimedia content, collaborating with experienced developers to craft a user-friendly interface. This experience enhanced my JavaScript abilities, provided insight into web architectures, and offered practical full-stack development experience, alongside learning professional work ethic and adherence to project deadlines.<br><br>- Ministère des Armées: During my six-month internship at the Ministry of the Armed Forces, I designed and implemented a user interface (UI) for remote management systems. This project involved in-depth research and application of advanced programming techniques to ensure the UI was both intuitive and efficient, catering to the specific needs of defense operations. My work contributed significantly to enhancing the operability and user experience of the remote management system, allowing for more effective control and monitoring. This experience not only honed my technical skills in UI design but also deepened my understanding of its application in critical defense infrastructure."
